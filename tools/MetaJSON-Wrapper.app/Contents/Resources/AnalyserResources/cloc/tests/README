To run the tests:
  cd ../Unix
  make test

Tests 21 through 24 in t/01_opts.t exercise cloc's ability to work
with git submodules (specifically, to ignore code in these).  If 
you're working with a git repo clone you will need to update the
submodule via
  git submodule init
  git submodule update
issued within your cloc working directory to get the tests to pass.
The submodule will populate the directory
tests/inputs/issues/131/cloc_submodule_test/
