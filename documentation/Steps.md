# Steps

You can find documentation of the existing Steps here. An overview of the complete project and links to other documentation can be found in the [README](../README.md).

# What is it?

Steps are lanes and functions which perform a simple task. Not like flow which calls multiple steps. They are grouped into files in the steps folder. These files are related to the same topic. There are no classes or something similar, it's just about keeping the files relatively small and to improve the readability of each step by placing them in a file with a certain topic.

# Step Groups

- CocoaPods
- Danger
- Git
- GitHub
- HockeyApp
- iTunesConnect
- MetaJSON
- Notifications
- PhraseApp

All the single steps aren't documented here. Please see the source file for details.
