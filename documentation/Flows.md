# Flows

You can find documentation of the existing Flows here. An overview of the complete project and links to other documentation can be found in the [README](../README.md).

# Goal

A huge part of the logic to support the [Fastlane commons vision](../README.md#Goal) is to provide Flows. A flow should normally be the only Commons function which is called from a project during a build job. They perform the usual workflows across all apps. Diferences between projects are handled with the [configuration](Configuration.md).


# Flows

Note: internal lanes should normally only be called from Fastlane commons code internally.
